1.Look through ALL files before making changes.
2.Go through all files and check structure and flow throughout frontend and backend.
3. Keep a knowledge of when functionality works and keep this in mind before making new changes or adding new features.
4. Try not to mess up the structure of large code files which could cause erros and double check that you havent made any mistakes.
5. Only do changes to UI that I ask and not change the UI of anything else or the functionality.
6. Dont change the functioanlity of of the UI when im asking for just UI changes that dont need new functioanlity.
